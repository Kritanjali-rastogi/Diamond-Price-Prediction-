# Diamond Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other relevant attributes. By analyzing a dataset of diamond characteristics and prices, the model will learn patterns and relationships that can be used to estimate the value of diamonds accurately.
